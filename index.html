Welcome to My Personal Space!
Hello! I'm Li Shuhao, currently working as a Technical Business (TB) Intern at 51world. My passion lies in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), data analysis, and machine learning, where I combine my technical expertise with a deep interest in urban analytics and sustainable development.

üåç Industry Focus:
I specialize in GIS software development, WebGIS, spatial data analysis, and remote sensing. My work often intersects with urban planning, environmental sustainability, and data science, where I use tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, and Python to analyze and visualize complex spatial data. I am particularly interested in applying machine learning to improve predictive models for urbanization trends, soil erosion, and other environmental factors.

üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Expertise:
Data Analysis: Expertise in Python, R, and machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Skilled in data visualization using Tableau, Matplotlib, and ggplot2.
Web Development: Proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and OpenLayers for building interactive web maps and GIS platforms.
GIS & Remote Sensing: Advanced knowledge in ArcGIS, GeoPandas, and remote sensing software like ENVI for analyzing satellite imagery and environmental data.
Machine Learning: Experienced in applying regression, classification, and clustering algorithms to geographic datasets.
üéì Academic Background:
Master‚Äôs: MSc in Geographic Data Science and Spatial Analytics, University of Bristol (Expected 2024)
Bachelor‚Äôs: Geographic Information Science, Jiangxi University of Science and Technology (2023)
üéØ Achievements:
Awarded multiple academic scholarships for excellence, including the Zhang Wenhai Academician Scholarship and First-class Scholarship.
Recognized in GIS competitions, winning the Second Prize at the "Yizhirui Cup" National University GIS Software Development Competition.
Public speaker: Winner of the National English Speech Contest ("Foreign Languages Society National Talent Cup").
üéÆ Personal Interests:
Beyond academia, I‚Äôm passionate about exploring the intersection of technology and sustainability. When I'm not analyzing data or coding, I enjoy participating in community volunteer work, sports, and indulging in my love for video games, particularly RPGs.
